    "This project simulates a pressure monitoring solution for an Oil & Gas Company using Microsoft Azure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "XYZ Oil & Gas Company requires continuous monitoring of pressure levels across its facilities to ensure operational safety and efficiency. This project aims to develop a pressure monitoring and analysis system using Azure to collect, analyze, and visualize pressure data in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **azure_pressure_monitoring.py**: Python script that simulates a device sending pressure data to Azure IoT Hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Azure IoT Hub Setup**:\n",
    "   - Create an Azure IoT Hub instance.\n",
    "   - Obtain the connection string for your IoT Hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Python Environment Setup**:\n",
    "   - Clone this repository.\n",
    "   - Install required Python packages:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run the Simulation**:\n",
    "   - Update `azure_pressure_monitoring.py` with your IoT Hub connection string (`CONNECTION_STRING`).\n",
    "   - Execute the script:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     python azure_pressure_monitoring.py\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - The script will simulate sending pressure data to your Azure IoT Hub at regular intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement Azure services for real-time data processing, storage, and visualization based on the collected pressure data.\n",
    "- Scale the solution to include multiple devices and optimize for production deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details, refer to the [Azure IoT Hub documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/).\n"
